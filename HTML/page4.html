        <p>Edvard Munch (1863-1944) was a Norwegian painter
            and printmaker known for "The Scream," an iconic 
            depiction of existential anxiety. His art delved 
            into themes of illness, death, and raw emotion, 
            using bold colors and distorted forms. Munch's 
            traumatic childhood profoundly shaped his expressive 
            and influential style in the Symbolist and Expressionist 
            movements.</p>
